### Next js

- Next is a React frontend development web framework created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation.

#### React vs Next

1. React JS
   - Not quite possible to build a full feature rich application ready to be deployed for production
   - React is a library for building user interfaces
   - You have to make decisions on other features of the app like routing, styling, authentication etc.
2. Next JS
   - A package that uses React for building user interface
   - Loaded with a lot more feature that enable you to build full fledged production ready application.
   - Features exactly like routing, styling, authentication, bundle optimization etc.
   - There's no need to install additional packages, Next.js provides everything for you.
   - Opinions and conversions need to be followed to implement the above said feature

#### Why learn Next JS

Next.js simplifies the process of building a React application for production.

1. File based routing
2. Pre-rendering
3. API routes
4. Support for CSS modules
5. Authentication
6. Dev and Prod build system

### Routing

1. Page based routing mechanism - Pages are associated with a route based on their file name
2. Nested routes - Nested folder structure, files wil be automatically routed in the same way in the URL
3. Dynamic routes - Can be created by adding square brackets to a page name
4. Catch all routes - Add three dots inside square brackets to create catch all route. Helpful when you want different URL's for the same page layout or even when you're working with pages where some of the route parameters are optional
5. Link components to navigate on click of an element
6. useRouter hook's router.push or router.replace method to navigate programmatically
7. How to create a custom 404 page
